I grew up on TV. Well, not literally. Growing up in the Dominican Republic, I was obsessed with American television. So much so that at age 7, when my family and I immigrated to the United States, I already spoke English fluently. Throughout my early childhood, I dreamed of working in movies, though not in front of the camera. I wanted to be a pyrotechnician, setting up all the cool special effects in the movies I loved (I suspect I'm not the only kid who dreamt of blowing stuff up for a living).

Yada-yada-yada, shit happens. I got slightly more practical. Went to the University of Florida (criminology degrees are practical, right!?). Went to law school. Got an amazing job as a prosecutor for the Department of Homeland Security and moved to New York City. Then one day, I happened on a Facebook post look for contestants on a new reality TV show, Whodunnit?, billed as CSI meets Survivor. "What the hell," I thought, "sounds fun." Competing on Whodunnit? was extremely fun; and it brought back all of those childhood dreams of making film and TV.

So here I am, ditching practicality to pursue a childhood dream. Here goes nothing!
